## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Additional Considerations
- **SEO and Accessibility**: The `index.html` file includes meta tags for SEO and mentions accessibility compliance, which aligns with the `README.md` features.
- **Dark Theme Header**: The `Header.tsx` component confirms the use of a dark theme with a gradient (lines 5-6).
- **Interactive Skill Cards**: The `Skills.tsx` component uses Framer Motion for animations, supporting the interactive feature (lines 1-62).
