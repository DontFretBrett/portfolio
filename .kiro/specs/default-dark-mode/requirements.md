# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will change the default theme behavior of the portfolio website to prefer dark mode when no system preference is detected or available. Currently, the site defaults to light mode, but dark mode is generally preferred by developers and technical audiences who make up the primary user base.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio website, I want the site to default to dark mode when I have no system theme preference set, so that I get a more comfortable viewing experience that aligns with developer preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site AND their system has no theme preference set THEN the system SHALL display the site in dark mode
2. WHEN a user visits the site AND their system preference is explicitly set to light mode THEN the system SHALL display the site in light mode
3. WHEN a user visits the site AND their system preference is explicitly set to dark mode THEN the system SHALL display the site in dark mode
4. WHEN a user manually toggles the theme using the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL respect and persist that manual choice over the default behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning visitor, I want my manual theme preference to be remembered across sessions, so that I don't have to reset my preferred theme every time I visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user manually selects a theme preference THEN the system SHALL store that preference in localStorage
2. WHEN a user returns to the site AND has a stored theme preference THEN the system SHALL use the stored preference instead of the default dark mode
3. WHEN a user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default dark mode behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the theme change to not cause any visual disruption or accessibility issues, so that I can continue using the site comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the default theme is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing accessibility features
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL not cause any flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
3. WHEN using screen readers or other assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL continue to work properly with the new default theme
