Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Brett Sanders, and I'm excited to share my journey through technology leadership, full-stack development, and the evolving world of AI.

## A Little About Me

My story with technology began when I was just 12 years old, obsessively coding and building tools and games. This was back in the days before YouTube tutorials, StackOverflow answers, or AI assistants – just pure curiosity and determination driving me to figure things out. What started as a hobby quickly turned into something more when I realized my skills could provide significant value to companies, which I found immensely rewarding.

Fast forward to today, and I'm a technology leader with over 15 years of experience, primarily in the financial sector. I've worn many hats throughout my career – from developer to director – but the common thread has always been my passion for building high-quality, maintainable systems and fostering high-performing teams.

## My Professional Journey

Currently, I serve as a Software Engineering Director at Truist Bank's LightStream division, where I lead multiple engineering teams responsible for consumer lending platforms. It's been an incredible journey getting here:

- **Started as a Sr Software Engineer & Team Lead** in 2016, spearheading a complete website rebuild
- **Grew into Application Development Manager** in 2019, leading platform improvements that boosted conversion rates
- **Became Solutions Architect** in 2020, architecting microservice-based distributed systems
- **Now as Director** since 2022, overseeing public websites, analytics, accessibility initiatives, and various internal systems

Before LightStream, I spent several years at US Bank in their Small Business Administration and Manufactured Housing Finance divisions, where I cut my teeth on .NET technologies and learned the importance of automation and process improvement.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about several key areas:

**Building Quality Systems**: There's something deeply satisfying about architecting solutions that are not only functional but maintainable, scalable, and efficient. I believe in doing things right the first time.

**Team Leadership**: One of the most rewarding aspects of my role is mentoring other engineers and fostering environments where teams can do their best work. I've learned that great technology comes from great teams.

**Continuous Learning**: The tech landscape never stops evolving, and neither do I. Whether it's mastering new cloud technologies, diving deep into AI frameworks, or staying current with development best practices, I'm always learning.

**Automation & Efficiency**: If there's a manual process, there's probably a way to automate it. I love finding ways to eliminate repetitive work so teams can focus on what really matters.

## My Technical Toolkit

Over the years, I've built expertise across the full technology stack:

- **Backend**: Node.js, C# .NET (Framework/Core), ASP.NET, microservices, RESTful APIs
- **Frontend**: React, Angular, TypeScript, responsive design, modern CSS
- **Database**: SQL Server, AWS RDS, DynamoDB, Entity Framework
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (certified), Azure, CI/CD pipelines, containerization
- **AI & Modern Tools**: OpenAI APIs, various AI frameworks, prompt engineering

## Recent Adventures in AI

Most recently, I've been diving deep into the world of AI agents and autonomous systems. The rapid evolution in this space is absolutely fascinating, and I believe we're at a pivotal moment where AI will fundamentally transform how we build and interact with software systems.

I recently completed an intensive course on Agentic AI Engineering, exploring frameworks like OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol. The potential for autonomous AI systems to revolutionize business processes is enormous, and I'm excited to be at the forefront of this transformation.

## What You Can Expect Here

This blog will be my space to share thoughts on:

- **Technology Leadership**: Lessons learned from leading engineering teams and projects
- **Full-Stack Development**: Deep dives into modern development practices and architectures
- **AI & Automation**: Exploring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and its practical applications
- **Career Growth**: Insights from my journey from a 12-year-old coder to technology director
- **Industry Trends**: My take on where technology is heading and what it means for businesses

## Let's Connect

I believe the best learning happens through conversation and collaboration. Whether you're a fellow engineer, a technology leader, or someone curious about the intersection of business and technology, I'd love to connect.
