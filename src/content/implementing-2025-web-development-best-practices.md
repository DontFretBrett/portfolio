The web development landscape has evolved significantly in 2025, with new standards, stricter accessibility requirements, and powerful performance optimizations. Recently, I undertook a comprehensive transformation of my portfolio to align with the latest 2025 best practices across TypeScript, CSS, accessibility, and performance optimization. Here's what I learned and implemented.

## The Challenge: Meeting 2025 Standards

With the new ADA Title II Web Accessibility Rule taking effect in 2026, WCAG 2.2 becoming the standard, and CSS gaining powerful new features, it was time to ensure my portfolio represented the cutting edge of modern web development. The goal was to achieve ~90% compliance with all major 2025 best practices while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.

## TypeScript 2025: Embracing Maximum Type Safety

### Enhanced Strict Mode Configuration

TypeScript 2025 demands nothing less than maximum type safety. I implemented a comprehensive strict configuration that goes beyond the basic `strict: true`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "allowUnusedLabels": false,
    "allowUnreachableCode": false,
    
    // Modern module system
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    
    // Path mapping for cleaner imports
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["./src/pages/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["./src/utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Type Patterns

I implemented several modern TypeScript patterns that represent 2025 best practices:

**Branded Types for Domain Safety:**
```typescript
declare const __themeBrand: unique symbol;
type Theme = ('light' | 'dark') & { [__themeBrand]: never };
```

**Result Types for Error Handling:**
```typescript
type ThemeResult<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: string };
```

**Enhanced Hook Patterns with useCallback:**
```typescript
const setTheme = React.useCallback((newTheme: Theme): void => {
  const themeResult = createTheme(newTheme);
  if (!themeResult.success) {
    console.error('Invalid theme:', themeResult.error);
    return;
  }
  setThemeState(themeResult.data);
}, []);
```

## CSS 2025: Modern Features for Better Performance

### Container Queries - Component-Level Responsiveness

One of the most exciting additions was container queries, enabling true component-based responsive design:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: card;
}

@container card (min-width: 400px) {
  .card-content {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization with content-visibility

The `content-visibility` property provides dramatic rendering performance improvements:

```css
.below-fold-section {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: auto 300px;
}
```

This single property can reduce initial rendering time by 30-50% for content below the fold.

### Modern Focus Management

WCAG 2.2 introduces new requirements for focus indicators. I implemented enhanced focus management that ensures indicators are never obscured:

```css
button:focus-visible,
a:focus-visible,
input:focus-visible,
textarea:focus-visible,
[tabindex]:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
  z-index: 999;
  position: relative;
}

.dark button:focus-visible,
.dark a:focus-visible,
.dark input:focus-visible,
.dark textarea:focus-visible,
.dark [tabindex]:focus-visible {
  outline-color: #60a5fa;
}
```

## WCAG 2.2 & ADA 2025 Compliance

### Skip Navigation Implementation

One of the most important accessibility features is skip navigation, allowing keyboard users to bypass repetitive content:

```html
<a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 6px;
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 8px;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  z-index: 1000;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  top: 6px;
}
```

### Reduced Motion Respect

Modern accessibility requires respecting user preferences for reduced motion:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
  
  .animate-spin,
  .animate-pulse,
  .animate-bounce {
    animation: none !important;
  }
}
```

### High Contrast Support

WCAG 2.2 emphasizes better support for high contrast preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-contrast: high) {
  .button,
  button {
    border: 2px solid currentColor !important;
  }
  
  .card {
    outline: 1px solid currentColor;
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Touch Targets

All interactive elements now meet the minimum 44px touch target size:

```css
.touch-target {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
  padding: 8px;
}
```

## Performance Optimization: Modern Loading Strategies

### Advanced Resource Preloading

Strategic resource preloading significantly improves performance:

```html
<!-- Critical Resource Preloading -->
<link rel="preload" href="/me.webp" as="image" type="image/webp" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://api.analytics.com" />
```

### Enhanced Code Splitting

I implemented sophisticated code splitting strategies in Vite:

```javascript
// Enhanced code splitting strategy
manualChunks: (id) => {
  // Vendor libraries
  if (id.includes('node_modules')) {
    if (id.includes('react') || id.includes('react-dom')) {
      return 'react-vendor';
    }
    if (id.includes('framer-motion') || id.includes('lucide-react')) {
      return 'ui-vendor';
    }
    if (id.includes('markdown') || id.includes('highlight')) {
      return 'markdown-vendor';
    }
    return 'vendor';
  }
  
  // App chunks by feature
  if (id.includes('/components/')) return 'components';
  if (id.includes('/pages/')) return 'pages';
  if (id.includes('/utils/')) return 'utils';
}
```

### Component-Level Lazy Loading

Strategic lazy loading reduces initial bundle size:

```typescript
// Lazy load larger components
const Experience = lazy(() => import('../components/Experience'));
const Certifications = lazy(() => import('../components/Certifications'));

// Enhanced loading component
function ComponentLoader({ message = "Loading..." }: { message?: string }) {
  return (
    <section className="p-16 text-center bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-blue-600 dark:border-blue-400 mx-auto"></div>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">{message}</p>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## SEO Excellence: Comprehensive Structured Data

### Enhanced Person Schema

Rich structured data helps search engines understand content:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Brett Sanders",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineering Director",
  "knowsAbout": [
    "Software Engineering",
    "AI Engineering",
    "AWS",
    "React",
    "TypeScript"
  ],
  "hasOccupation": {
    "@type": "Occupation",
    "name": "Software Engineering Director"
  }
}
```

### FAQ Schema for Better Visibility

FAQ schema improves search result appearance:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is Brett Sanders' expertise?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Brett Sanders is a Software Engineering Director with expertise in full stack development, AWS cloud services, team leadership, and AI engineering."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Build Optimization: Modern Tooling

### Advanced Vite Configuration

The build system received significant enhancements:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
      jsxImportSource: 'react',
    }),
    viteCompression({
      algorithm: 'gzip',
      ext: '.gz',
    }),
    viteCompression({
      algorithm: 'brotliCompress',
      ext: '.br',
    })
  ],
  
  build: {
    target: ['es2022', 'chrome87', 'firefox78', 'safari14', 'edge88'],
    minify: 'terser',
    terserOptions: {
      compress: {
        drop_console: true,
        drop_debugger: true,
        passes: 2,
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Tailwind Enhancements

Enhanced Tailwind configuration with modern features:

```javascript
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'focus': '#0066cc',
        'focus-dark': '#60a5fa',
      },
      animation: {
        'fade-in': 'fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out',
        'slide-up': 'slideUp 0.3s ease-out',
      },
    },
  },
  future: {
    hoverOnlyWhenSupported: true,
  },
};
```
