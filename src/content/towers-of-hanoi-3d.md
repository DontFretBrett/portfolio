# Building a Modern 3D Towers of Hanoi Game with Three.js and GSAP

The Towers of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that has fascinated minds for generations. While it has been reimagined countless times, creating a polished 3D version presents unique challenges in terms of user interaction, performance, and visual appeal. I took on this challenge by building an interactive 3D version using modern web technologies.

## Technical Stack Overview

I built this project using a modern JavaScript stack:
- Three.js for 3D rendering and scene management
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth animations
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Vanilla JavaScript with ES6+ features
- Vercel for deployment

## Architecture and Design Patterns

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. The core structure is organized into several key managers:

1. **App Class**: The main orchestrator that initializes and connects all components
2. **Scene Manager**: Handles the 3D scene setup and rendering
3. **Game Manager**: Controls game logic and state
4. **Event Manager**: Manages user interactions
5. **UI Manager**: Handles the game's interface elements
6. **Audio Manager**: Controls sound effects and audio feedback

## Game Components

The 3D elements are carefully modeled as distinct components:
- **Rods**: Represented as cylindrical meshes with custom positioning
- **Disks**: Implemented with varying radii and colors
- **Table**: Provides the game surface with a wood-grain texture

## Core Game Logic

The game's core mechanics are handled by the GameManager class, which implements several key features:

### Disk Management
- Dynamic disk creation based on difficulty level (3-10 disks)
- Automatic radius calculation for visual consistency
- Color assignment from a predefined palette

### Move Validation
- Real-time checking of move legality
- Prevention of larger disks being placed on smaller ones
- Destination rod highlighting for better user guidance

### State Management
- Track selected disks and valid moves
- Maintain move counter and timer
- Calculate optimal moves for the current configuration

## User Interaction

The game supports multiple input methods:
- Mouse/touch interaction for disk selection and movement
- Keyboard controls (numbers 1-3) for rod selection
- Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes

## Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations ensure smooth gameplay:

### Object Pooling
- Reuse of 3D objects to minimize garbage collection
- Efficient management of disk creation and destruction

### Render Optimization
- Selective rendering of changed elements
- Optimized animation frames

### Resource Management
- Preloading of textures and audio
- Efficient memory usage through proper object disposal

## Advanced Features

### 1. Randomization
The game includes a sophisticated randomization feature that:
- Creates valid random configurations
- Ensures puzzles are solvable
- Maintains game rules during randomization

### 2. Win Detection
Victory conditions are checked by:
- Verifying all disks are on the destination rod
- Confirming correct disk ordering
- Comparing against optimal move count

### 3. Debug Tools
During development, a debug panel provides:
- Real-time state inspection
- Performance monitoring
- Move validation checking

## Challenges and Solutions

### Physics Simulation
Instead of using a full physics engine, I implemented simplified movement constraints and animations, reducing computational overhead while maintaining visual appeal.

### Cross-browser Compatibility
The implementation uses standard Web APIs and includes fallbacks for broader browser support.

### Mobile Optimization
Touch events are carefully handled to provide a smooth mobile experience, with appropriate hit areas and gesture recognition.

## Future Enhancements

The codebase is structured to allow for several potential enhancements:
- Multiplayer support
- Additional difficulty modes
- Custom disk themes
- Achievement system
- Move replay functionality
- Mobile touch support improvements
- Automated solution visualization
- Additional visual themes

## Conclusion

This implementation of Towers of Hanoi demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to create an engaging 3D game while maintaining good performance and code maintainability. The component-based architecture and careful consideration of performance optimizations result in a smooth and responsive user experience.

The project serves as an excellent example of combining 3D graphics, user interaction, and game logic in a web application, while maintaining clean code structure and following software engineering best practices.
