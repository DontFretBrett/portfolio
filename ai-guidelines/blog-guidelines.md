## üìÅ File Structure & Naming

### File Location
- All blog posts MUST be placed in: `/src/content/`
- Extension: `.md` (Markdown format)

### File Naming Convention
- **Format**: `kebab-case.md` (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Pattern**: `{descriptive-title}.md`
- **Examples**:
  - ‚úÖ `implementing-react-19-best-practices-portfolio.md`
  - ‚úÖ `ai-image-validator-autogen-blog-post.md`
  - ‚ùå `My New Blog Post.md`
  - ‚ùå `blogPost2025.md`

### Slug Generation
- Slug is automatically generated from filename (removes `.md` extension)
- Filename becomes the URL: `/blog/{filename-without-md}`
- Choose filenames carefully as they become permanent URLs

## üîç SEO & Crawlability

### Static HTML Generation
- All blog posts automatically generate static HTML for crawlers
- Located in `/dist/blog/{slug}/index.html` after build
- Contains full metadata and structured data

### Meta Tags
The system automatically generates:
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter Card metadata
- Canonical URLs
- Author information

### Structured Data
Automatic JSON-LD structured data includes:
- BlogPosting schema
- Author information
- Publication dates
- Keywords and tags
- Reading time

### Crawlability Features
- ‚úÖ Static HTML versions for AI crawlers
- ‚úÖ Proper robots.txt permissions
- ‚úÖ XML sitemap inclusion
- ‚úÖ Clean URL structure
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly responsive design

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### File Processing
1. **Markdown Parsing**: Frontmatter extracted and processed
2. **Content Processing**: Markdown converted to HTML
3. **Reading Time**: Automatically calculated (200 words/minute)
4. **Slug Generation**: Based on filename
5. **Static Generation**: HTML versions created for crawlers
6. **Error Handling**: Robust loading with Promise.allSettled to prevent partial failures

### TypeScript Types
Blog posts conform to the `BlogPost` interface:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  excerpt: string;
  content: string;
  date: string;
  readingTime: number;
  tags?: string[];
  description?: string;
  keywords?: string;
}
```

### Automatic Processing
- Reading time calculation
- Content caching for performance
- Lazy loading of markdown files with robust error handling
- Promise.allSettled-based loading prevents partial failures
- Improved error resilience for individual post loading issues

## ‚úÖ Quality Checklist

### Before Publishing
- [ ] Frontmatter includes all required fields
- [ ] Title is SEO-optimized (50-70 characters)
- [ ] Date is current and properly formatted
- [ ] Excerpt is engaging and concise
- [ ] Description includes keywords and author name
- [ ] Tags are relevant and follow naming conventions
- [ ] Content is well-structured with proper headings
- [ ] Code examples are tested and properly formatted
- [ ] Images have alt text and are optimized
- [ ] Links work correctly
- [ ] Spelling and grammar checked

### After Publishing
- [ ] Static HTML generated correctly
- [ ] Post appears in blog index
- [ ] SEO meta tags present
- [ ] Social sharing works
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Crawlable by search engines

---

## üîß Build Process

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
pnpm build
```
This automatically:
1. Compiles TypeScript
2. Builds Vite project
3. Generates static HTML for all blog posts
4. Updates sitemap
5. Optimizes assets

### Static Blog Generation
The build process creates static HTML versions in `/dist/blog/`:
- `/dist/blog/index.html` - Blog index page
- `/dist/blog/{slug}/index.html` - Individual post pages

These static files ensure AI crawlers can access your content.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Frontmatter Fields
**Error**: Blog post not displaying correctly
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are present and properly formatted

#### Incorrect Date Format
**Error**: Posts not sorting correctly
**Solution**: Use `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format in quotes

#### Malformed Tags Array
**Error**: Tags not displaying
**Solution**: Use proper array syntax: `["tag1", "tag2"]`

#### File Not Found
**Error**: Blog post not loading
**Solution**: Verify file is in `/src/content/` with `.md` extension

#### Blog Loading Issues
**Error**: Only some posts load on first visit, rest appear after refresh
**Solution**: System now uses Promise.allSettled for robust loading - if this occurs, check console for individual post errors

### Static Generation Issues
If static HTML isn't generating:
1. Check console for build errors
2. Verify all frontmatter is valid
3. Ensure no syntax errors in markdown
4. Run `pnpm build` to see specific errors
5. Check for individual post loading failures (system handles partial failures gracefully)

### SEO Issues
If SEO meta tags are missing:
1. Check frontmatter completeness
2. Verify description and keywords fields
3. Ensure proper quote formatting
4. Check generated HTML in `/dist/blog/`
